		<h2 id="vision" class="header">Vision and Light</h2>
		<p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring - noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat and targeting a spell - rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove significant hindrances.</p>
		<h4 id="lightly-obscured" class="header">Lightly Obscured</h4>
		<p>Dim light, patchy fog or dense foliage. Creatures have disadvantage on <i>Wisdom (Perception)</i> checks that rely on site.</p>
		<h4 id="heavily-obscured" class="header">Heavily Obscured</h4>
		<p>Darkness, opaque fog or dense foliage blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from a blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.</p>
		<p>There are three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light and darkness.</p>
		<h4 id="bright-light" class="header">Bright Light</h4>
		<p>Most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</p>
		<h4 id="dim-light" class="header">Dim Light</h4>
		<p>Also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light and darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</p>
		<h4 id="darkness" class="header">Darkness</h4>
		<p>Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights, when in the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</p>
		<h3 id="blinded" class="header">Blinded (Condition)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</li>
			<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="header" id="blindsight">Blindsight</h3>
		<p>A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.</p>
		<h3 class="header" id="darkvision">Darkvision</h3>
		<p>Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. Areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in that darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
		<h3 class="header" id="truesight">Truesight</h3>
		<p>A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>See in normal and magical darkness</li>
			<li>See invisible creatures and objects</li>
			<li>Automatically detect visual illusions</li>
			<li>Succeed on saving throws against them</li>
			<li>Perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic</li>
			<li>See into the Etheral Plane.</li>
		</ul>
