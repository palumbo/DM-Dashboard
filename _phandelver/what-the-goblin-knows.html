		<p>If the character captures or charms any of the goblins here, the goblins can be persuaded to divulge some useful information: 
			<ul>
				<li>Fewer than 20 goblins currently dwell in their lair.</li>
				<li>Their leader is a bugbear named Klarg. He answers to King Grol, chief of the Cragmaw tribe, who dwells in Cragmaw Castle. (The goblins can provide basic directions to Cragmaw Castle. It's about 20 miles NE of the Cragmaw hideout, in Neverwinter Wood.)</li>
				<li>Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named the Black Spider was paying the Cragmaws to watch out for the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker, capture him and send him and anything he was carrying back to King Grol. Klark followed his orders. Gundred was ambushed and taken along with his personal effects, including a map.</li>
				<li>The dwarf and his map were delivered to King Grol, as instructed. The dwarf's human companion is being held in the "eating cave" (area 6).</li>
			</ul>
