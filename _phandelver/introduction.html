		<h2 id="improvising_ability_checks">Improvising Ability Checks</h2>
		<p>The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation and the Difficult Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes adventurers try things that the adventure can't possibly anticipate. It's up to you to decide whether their attempts are successful.</p>
		<p>If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don't ask for an <i>ability check</i>; just tell the player what happens.</p>
		<p>Likewise, if there is now way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.</p>
		<p>Otherwise, answer these 3 simple questions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>What kind of ability check?</li>
				<li>How hard is it?</li>
				<li>What's the result</li>
			</ol>
		<p>The easiest way to set a DC is to decide whether the task is easy, moderate or hard, and use these three DCs:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Easy (DC 10).</b> An easy task requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.</li>
			<li><b>Moderate (DC 15).</b> A moderate task requires a slightly higher level of competence to accomplish.</li>
			<li><b>Hard (DC 20).</b> Hard tasks include any effort that is beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability. Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some luck.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
		<p>More than 500 years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an arrangement known as Phandelver's Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the swarves and gnomes to channel adn bind that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spirits), where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town on Phandalin (pronounced <i>fan</i>-duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swpt through the North and laid waste to all in their path.</p>
		<p>A powerful force or orcs reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Waved Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge or Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.</p>
		<p>For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town. More important, the Rockseeker brothers - a trio of dwarves - have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines. </p>
		<p>Unfortunately for the Rockerseekers, they are not hte only ones interested in Wave Echo Cave. A mysterious villain known as the Black Spider controls a network of bandit gangs and goblin tribes in the area, and his agents have followed the Rockseekers to their prize. Now the Black Spider wants Wave Echo Cave for himself, and he is taking steps to make sure no one else knows where it is.</p>

		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<h3 id="goblin-arrows">Part One: Goblin Arrows</h3>
		<p>The adventurers are on the road to the town of Phandalin when they stumble into a goblin ambush. They discover that the goblins (who belong to the Cragmaw Tribe) have captured their dwarf friend Gundren Rockseeker and his escort, a human warrior named Sildar Hallwinter. The characters must deal with the ambushers and then follow their trail back to the goblin's hideout. They rescue Sildar and learn from him that Gundren and his brothers discovered a famous lost mine. Sildar knows only that Gundred and his map have been taken to somewhere called "Cragmaw Castle."</p>
		<h3 id="phandalin">Part Two: Phandalin</h3>
		<p>The characters arrive in Phandalin to find it terrorized by the Redbrands, a gang of miscreants led by a mysterious figure called Glasstaff. A number of interesting NPCs can also be found in Phandalin, laying the hooks for short adventures in part 3. The Redbrands try to run the characters out of town, so the characters return the favor and storm the Redbrand lair. In a hidden stronghold beneath an old manor, they find that Iarno "Glasstaff" Albrek, the leader of the Redbrands, is taking his orders from someone called the Black Spider - and that the Black Spider wants the adventurers out of the pictures.</p>
		<h3 id="spiders_web">Part Three: The Spider's Web</h3>
		<p>This part provides the characters with several short adventures in the region around Phandalin as they search for more information about the Black SPider and the dwarves' lost mine. The clues the characters picked up in Phandalin can lead them to spy on a mysterious wizard at the ruins of Old Owl Well, seek the advice of a dangerous banshee, oust a band of orcs lurking at Wyvern Tor, and investigate the ruins of the town of Thundertree.</p>
		<p>Several of these leads point to Cragmaw Castle, which is the stronghold of King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw goblins. Here the characters discover that the Black Spider is a drow adventurer named Nezznar, and that the Cragmaw goblins work for him (droware elves who hail from a realm deep underground). More importantly, they recover Gundren Rockseeker's map to the lost mine, or learn the mine's location from one of the other leads they unearth during part 3. </p>
		<h3 id="wave-echo-cave">Part Four: Wave Echo Cave</h3>
		<p>Following the map or the directions to the lost mines brings the characters to part 4, "Wave Echo Cave." Taht lost underground complex is now overrun by undead and strange monsters. Nezznar the Black Spider is there with his loyal followers, exploring the mines and searching for the legendary Forge of Spells. The adventurers have the opportunity to avenge Gundred Rockseeker, to ensure the properity and security of Phandalin by clearing the rich mine of its monsters, and to put an end to the troublemaking of the Black Spider - if they can survive the dangers of the Lost Mind of Phandelver.</p>

		<h2 id="adventure_hook">Adventure Hook</h2>
		<p><b><i>Meet Me in Phandalin</i></b>. The characters are in the city of Neverwinter when their dwarf patron and friend, Gundren Rockseeker, hires them to escort a wagon to Phandalin. Gundred has gone ahead with a warrior, Sildar Hallwinter, to attend to business in the town while the characters follow with the supplies. The characters will be paid 10 gp each by the owner of Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin when they deliver the wagon safely to that trading post.</p>
