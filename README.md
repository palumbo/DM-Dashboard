# DM-Dashboard
So I recently got into Dungeons & Dragons (5E). Becuase I play with my kids and other people who have never played, I'm always the Dungeon Maste (aka DM). Since I'm still learning the rules, I wanted a quick, easy and (most importantly) fast way that I look up information without slowing the game. You can buy a really nice and somewhat useful DM screen, but I found it only partially useful. 

I started looking for a digital equivalent that was not only searchable, but customizable. If found some virtual table top platforms (i.e. [Fantasy Grounds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/home.php) and [Roll20](https://roll20.net)), but they're really designed to facilitate virtual session between players. What I want is a virtual DM dashboard for help me run games IRL. 

This project is an attempt to create a locally-hosted, browser-based DM dashboard that meets the following requirements: 
+ Contains an easily searchable database of all D&D rules (great for beginners) 
+ Contains an easily searchable database of all monsters (or at least the relevant ones for the current campaign)
+ Provides dialogue, maps, monster stat blocks and other DM-specific information to run a specific game or campaign
+ Offers a number of useful tools that would help a DM of any experience level run a successful game (i.e. virtual dice, battle calculators)

This dashboard in its current iteration is based on and represents all of the information contained in the [D&D 5E Starter Set](https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Starter-Set-Roleplaying/dp/0786965592/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1482709105&sr=8-1&keywords=D%26D+starter+set). This includes the _Starter Set Rulebook_ and _Lost Mines of Phandelver_ adventure book. Becuase of this, it is probably most useful for beginners. 

While I can say this code is freely downloadable and usable by any role playing fan, some (if not all) of the content is property of D&D and I'm not sure how freely available it is on the internet.
